# YOLOv2Tiny-Simulation
This Simulation is using for FPGA Verification Purpose. It is not fully-functioning. I highly recommended to use "**PyTorchSim-BN**". There are consists of 3 Types:
- PythonSim
- PyTorchSim-BN
- PyTorchSim-LN

For Running:
```
python YOLOv2Tiny_Simulation.py
```
It has 3 different mode: Training, Validation, and Inference.
